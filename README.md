Eateries is a service written in Node to provide details about Restaurants in the CBD.
Eateries has been designed with Koa , a fast and robust foundation for building Web APIs.
As far as UI concerned, I made a choice of Angular 11 , a powerful framework to build a front end.

SQLite3 is one of the fast database utilised by many companies around the world to build web applications.
SQLite3 is easy and  very fast for searching.
